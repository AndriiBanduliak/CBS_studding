# CyberBionic Systematics · Python Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to the central repository that tracks my progress through the 2025–2026 CyberBionic Systematics Python program. It aggregates individual exercises, homework assignments, and larger portfolio projects that showcase how the curriculum translates into production-grade code.

## Repository Highlights
- **Coursework & Labs** – Each standalone script in the root directory captures a focused Python concept, from control flow and data structures through to functional programming and testing.
- **Capstone Projects** – The `projects/` directory collects multi-module applications that emulate real-world product requirements (finance, CRM, gaming, and more).
- **Experimentation Space** – Notebook files and practice folders record exploratory work, quick prototypes, and additional study beyond the core syllabus.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present for the chosen project
   ```
3. Navigate into a specific project or script directory and follow its dedicated instructions (many projects include their own README).

## Repository Structure
- Top-level `.py` files & notebooks – incremental assignments, practical tasks, and algorithmic drills.
- `Essential/` – auxiliary practice scripts and notebooks grouped by topic.
- `projects/` – full-stack and domain-specific applications (see `projects/README.md` for curated overviews).

## Learning Objectives
- Build production-ready Python services with attention to testing, packaging, and deployment.
- Practice clean coding standards (PEP 8 compliance, static analysis, and CI-friendly practices).
- Develop domain knowledge across finance, CRM, gaming, and AI-driven assistants.
