Welcome to my repository for the Python course at Cyber Bionic Systematics.

## About This Repository

This space is dedicated to storing and documenting my solutions for all the homework, labs, and practical exercises assigned during the course. Each project or script reflects my learning journey through the fundamentals of Python programming.
